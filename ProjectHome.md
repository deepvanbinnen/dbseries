# DBSeries #

Most projects in the dbseries are CFML based and abstractions for the several parts of coding I've dealt with through the years. Within all projects there may be code that is just there for usage as snippet, proof of concept or just test.

These are the projects currently in or planned to be in the repositiory soon

## ebx ##
Fusebox3/5-like framework that evolved from a customtag mimicing fusebox3 in a non-fusebox environment

## xrad ##
A bunch of utils that ease and generalise commonly used patterns.
After discovering the possibilities with snipex, regexes and CF with regards to generating code, I found XRAD (or eXtreme Rapid Application Development) a nice tag for it :)

### commons ###
Set of common utils (coming soon)

### collections ###
Set of CFC's that handle collections (coming soon)

### iterator ###
CFC because I got tired of cfloop..
These are going to be part of the collectionsFactory..
(coming soon)

## generator ##
A front-end site using ebx and xrad aimed at generating code through a webinterface to show the possibilities with projects above

## dbobject ##
Database inspection and DAO framework
(coming soon)

## shell ##
A webbased CF-Shell
(coming soon)
